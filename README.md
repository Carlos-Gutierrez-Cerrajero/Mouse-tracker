# Mouse-tracker

## Description
<p id="Description">
  A very small program that constantly updates the cursor x and y positions and the RGB color of the current pixel. Useful for GUI automation, although I've used it to save RGB color codes for a variety of reasons.<br>
  This is my attempt to replicate the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/MouseInfo/">Mouse info module</a> prompted by the excellent book <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>, specifically chapter 20
</p>

## Dependencies
<p id="Dependencies">
  This program needs the <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pyautogui</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/">keyboard</a> modules (loggin and time as well, but those are part of the standard library).
